#  Overview of School District Analysis

## Introduction

Working with Maria, we created six Pandas Dataframes with the data from the school and student CSV files. After our initial analysis, it was brought to our attention that there was evidence of academic dishonesty amongst 9th graders from Thomas High School. To ensure an honest analysis, it was imperative that we replace the 9th grade Thomas high school data with NaN (Not A Number) values. The following report presents the effects of this change in the data.

## Results
