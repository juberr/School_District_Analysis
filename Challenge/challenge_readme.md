#  Overview of School District Analysis

## Introduction

Working with Maria, six Pandas dataframes were created with the data from the school and student CSV files. After the initial analysis, there was evidence of academic dishonesty amongst ninth graders from Thomas High School. To ensure an honest analysis, it was imperative that ninth grade Thomas High School data was replaced with NaN (Not A Number) values. The following report presents the effects of this change in the data. The screenshots in this analysis, when in pairs, are presented as before and then after (unless stated otherwise).

## Results

* How is the district summary affected? 
    * For the district summary, the average reading score stayed at 81.9, but all other metrics took a reduction after replacing all ninth grade data with NaNs.

    ![district summary after](https://github.com/juberr/School_District_Analysis/blob/main/Challenge/screenshots/district%20summary%20after.png?raw=true)

* How was the school summary affected? 
    * Across each metric (except average reading score), Thomas High School is reporting lower grades and passing percentages after replacing all ninth grade data with NaNs. Average reading score increased as a result of this change.

* How does replacing the ninth grader's math and reading scores affect Thomas High Schoolâ€™s performance relative to the other schools?
    * After replacing the ninth grader's math and reading scores with NaN values, Thomas High School's performance remains at second place overall in the district. Though the gap between Thomas High School and Griffin High School has become significantly closer (90.63 to 90.60)

* How did replacing ninth grade scores affect:

    * Math and reading scores by grade?

        * There is now no data for ninth graders from Thomas High School in both dataframes. The following screenshots present the math and then reading scores by grade dataframes

    * Scores by school funding?
        * No observable difference in scores by school funding once formatted.
    
    * Scores by school size
        * No observable difference in scores by school size once formatted.
    
    * Scores by school type
        * No observable difference in scores by school type once formatted.

# Summary

Removing all of the ninth grade scores from Thomas High School caused the following effects:

* Lowered the overall district summary dataframe for the average math score, overall passing math and reading percentage, and over all passing percentage

* Lowered average math score, overall passing math and reading percentage, and over all passing percentage for the school summary dataframe

* Brought the race for second place in overall school rankings much closer between Thomas High School and Griffin High School

* Makes no data available for the by grade analysis for Thomas High School ninth graders

To get a more representative picture, the extent of the academic dishonesty within Thomas High School ninth graders should be investigated. Removing every ninth grade THS student from the data also removes those students with legitimate scores. Without the legitimate scores in the data, this is more or less just a view of THS without ninth graders, rather than THS without academic dishonesty.
